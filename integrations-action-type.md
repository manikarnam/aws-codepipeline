## Source Action Integrations<a name="integrations-source"></a>

The following information is organized by CodePipeline action type and can help you configure CodePipeline to integrate with the products and services you use\.


|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
| Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) |  [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/) is storage for the internet\. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web\. You can configure CodePipeline to use a versioned Amazon S3 bucket as the source stage for your code\. You must first create the bucket and then enable versioning on it before you can create a pipeline that uses the bucket as part of a source action within a stage\.  Amazon S3 can also be included in a pipeline as a deploy action\.

| AWS CodeCommit |  [CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/) is a version control service hosted by AWS that you can use to privately store and manage assets \(such as documents, source code, and binary files\) in the cloud\. You can configure CodePipeline to use a branch in a CodeCommit repository as the source stage for your code\. You must first create the repository and associate it with a working directory on your local machine before you can create a pipeline that uses the branch as part of a source action within a stage\. You can connect to the CodeCommit repository by either creating a new pipeline or editing an existing one\.  Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html)  | 
| GitHub |   You can configure CodePipeline to use a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository as the source stage for your code\. You must have previously created a GitHub account and at least one GitHub repository\. You can connect to the GitHub repository by either creating a new pipeline or editing an existing one\.  CodePipeline integration with GitHub Enterprise is not supported\.  The first time you add a GitHub repository to a pipeline, you will be asked to authorize CodePipeline access to your repositories\. To integrate with GitHub, CodePipeline creates an OAuth application for your pipeline and, if your pipeline is created or updated in the console, CodePipeline creates a GitHub webhook that starts your pipeline when a change occurs in the repository\. The token and webhook require the following GitHub scopes: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html) For more information about GitHub scopes, see the [GitHub Developer API Reference](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes)\. Access for CodePipeline is configured for all repositories to which that GitHub account has access; it cannot currently be configured for individual repositories\. You can revoke this access from GitHub by choosing **Settings**, choosing **Applications**, and then, under **Authorized applications**, finding CodePipeline in the list of authorized applications and choosing **Revoke**\. Revoking access will immediately prevent CodePipeline from accessing any GitHub repositories previously configured for access with that GitHub account\.  If you want to limit the access CodePipeline has to specific set of repositories, create a GitHub account, grant that account access to only the repositories you want to integrate with CodePipeline, and then use that account when configuring CodePipeline to use GitHub repositories for source stages in pipelines\.

| Amazon ECR | [Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/) is an AWS Docker image repository service\. You use Docker push and pull commands to upload Docker images to your repository\. An Amazon ECR repository URI and image are used in Amazon ECS task definitions to reference source image information\.Learn more:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html) | 

## Build Action Integrations<a name="integrations-build"></a>


|  |  |

| AWS CodeBuild |  [CodeBuild](http://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) is a fully managed build service in the cloud\. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy\. You can add CodeBuild as a build action to the build stage of a pipeline\. You can use an existing build project or create one in the CodePipeline console\. The output of the build project can then be deployed as part of a pipeline\.  CodeBuild can also be included in a pipeline as a test action, with or without a build output\.  You can configure your pipeline to manage a CodeBuild project with multiple input and output artifacts\. For more information, see [CodePipeline Integration with CodeBuild and Multiple Input Sources and Output Artifacts Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-pipeline-multi-input-output.html)\.  For multiple output artifacts, you can configure your pipeline to to map output artifacts to the secondary artifacts in the build spec\. For multiple input artifacts, use the optional `PrimarySource` parameter in your pipeline structure to designate the directory where CodeBuild looks for and runs your build spec file\.
