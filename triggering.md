# Use CloudWatch Events to Start a Pipeline \(CodeCommit Source\)<a name="triggering"></a>

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger pipelines to start when rule or schedule criteria are met\. For pipelines with an Amazon S3 or CodeCommit source, an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule detects source changes and then starts your pipeline\. When you use the console to create or change a pipeline, the rule and all associated resources are created for you\. If you create or change an Amazon S3 or CodeCommit pipeline in the AWS CLI or AWS CloudFormation, you must use these steps to create the Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and all associated resources manually\.

In Amazon CloudWatch Events, you create a rule to detect and react to changes in the state of the pipeline's defined source\.

**To create the rule**

1. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that uses the pipeline's source repository as the event source\.

1. Add CodePipeline as the target\. 

1. Grant Amazon CloudWatch Events permissions to start the pipeline\.

As you build your rule, the **Event Pattern Preview** pane in the console \(or the `--event-pattern` output in the AWS CLI\) displays the event fields, in JSON format\. The following sample CodeCommit event pattern uses this JSON structure:

```
{
  "source": [ "aws.codecommit" ],
  "detail-type": [ "CodeCommit Repository State Change" ],
  "resources": [ "CodeCommitRepo_ARN" ],
  "detail": {
     "event": [
       "referenceCreated",
       "referenceUpdated"],
     "referenceType":["branch"],
     "referenceName": ["branch_name"]
  }
}
```

The event pattern uses these fields:
+ `source:` should contain `aws.codecommit` as the event source\. 
+ `detail-type:` displays the available event type \(`CodeCommit Repository State Change`\)\.
+ `resources:` contains the repository ARN\.
+ `detail:` contains the repository branch information, `referenceType` and `referenceName`\.
