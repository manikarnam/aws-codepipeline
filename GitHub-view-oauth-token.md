# View Your Authorized OAuth Apps<a name="GitHub-view-oauth-token"></a>

AWS CodePipeline uses OAuth tokens to integrate with GitHub\. GitHub tracks the permissions of the OAuth token for AWS CodePipeline\.

AWS creates a default AWS\-managed OAuth token when you use the console to create or update pipelines\. When your pipeline connects to the repository, it uses GitHub credentials to connect to GitHub\. You do not manage the token in any way, but you can view your connection information to verify your authorized OAuth applications in GitHub\.

Use these steps to review your authorized OAuth applications\.
