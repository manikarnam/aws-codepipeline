# Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline \(Amazon S3 Bucket\)<a name="tutorials-simple-s3"></a>

The easiest way to create a pipeline is to use the **Create pipeline** wizard in the AWS CodePipeline console\. 

In this walkthrough, you create a two\-stage pipeline that uses a versioned Amazon S3 bucket and CodeDeploy to release a sample application\. 

**Important**  
Many of the actions you add to your pipeline in this procedure involve AWS resources that you need to create before you create the pipeline\. AWS resources for your source actions must always be created in the same AWS Region where you create your pipeline\. For example, if you create your pipeline in the US East \(Ohio\) Region, your CodeCommit repository must be in the US East \(Ohio\) Region\.   
You can add cross\-region actions when you create your pipeline\. AWS resources for cross\-region actions must be in the same AWS Region where you plan to execute the action\. For more information about cross\-region actions, see [Add a Cross\-Region Action in CodePipeline](actions-create-cross-region.md)\.

After you create this simple pipeline, you add another stage and then disable and enable the transition between stages\.

Not what you're looking for? To create a simple pipeline using a CodeCommit branch as a code repository, see [Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline \(CodeCommit Repository\)](tutorials-simple-codecommit.md)\.

**Note**  
For pipelines with an Amazon S3 source, an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule detects source changes and then starts your pipeline when changes occur\. When you use the console to create or change a pipeline, the rule and all associated resources are created for you\. If you create or change an Amazon S3 pipeline in the CLI or AWS CloudFormation, you must create the Amazon CloudWatch Events rule, IAM role, and AWS CloudTrail trail manually\.

Before you begin, you should complete the prerequisites in [Getting Started with CodePipeline](getting-started-codepipeline.md)\.

## Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket for Your Application<a name="s3-create-s3-bucket"></a>

You can store your source files or applications in any versioned location\. In this tutorial, you create an Amazon S3 bucket for the sample applications and enable versioning on that bucket\. After you have enabled versioning, you copy the sample applications to that bucket\. 

If you want to use an existing Amazon S3 bucket, see [Enable Versioning for a Bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html), copy the sample applications to that bucket, and skip ahead to [Step 3: Create an Application in CodeDeploy](#S3-create-deployment)\. 

If you want to use a GitHub repository instead of an Amazon S3 bucket, copy the sample applications to that repository, and skip ahead to [Step 3: Create an Application in CodeDeploy](#S3-create-deployment)\.

**To create an Amazon S3 bucket**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. Choose **Create bucket**\.

1. In **Bucket name**, type a name for your bucket \(for example, **awscodepipeline\-demobucket\-example\-date**\)\.
**Note**  
Because all bucket names in Amazon S3 must be unique, use one of your own, not the name shown in the example\. You can change the example name just by adding the date to it\. Make a note of this name because you need it for the rest of this tutorial\.

   In **Region**, choose the region where you intend to create your pipeline, such as **US West \(Oregon\)**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Configure options** tab, in **Versioning**, select **Keep all versions of an object in the same bucket**, and then choose **Next**\.

   When versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 saves every version of every object in the bucket\.

1. On the **Set permissions** tab, accept the default permissions to allow your account read/write access on objects, and choose **Next**\. For more information about Amazon S3 bucket and object permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html)\.

1. Choose **Create bucket**\.

1. Next, download a sample from a GitHub repository and save it into a folder or directory on your local computer\.
**Important**  
Do not use the **Clone or download** or **Download ZIP** buttons in the GitHub repositories\. This creates a nested folder structure that does not work with CodeDeploy\.

   1. Open the GitHub repository that hosts the sample\.
      + If you want to deploy to Amazon Linux instances using CodeDeploy, use the sample in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-codepipeline-s3-aws-codedeploy_linux](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-codepipeline-s3-aws-codedeploy_linux)\.
      + If you want to deploy to Windows Server instances using CodeDeploy, use the sample in [https://github\.com/awslabs/AWSCodePipeline\-S3\-AWSCodeDeploy\_Windows](https://github.com/awslabs/AWSCodePipeline-S3-AWSCodeDeploy_Windows)\.

   1. Choose the **dist** folder\.

   1. Choose the file name\.
      + If you want to deploy to Amazon Linux instances, use `aws-codepipeline-s3-aws-codedeploy_linux.zip`\.
      + If you want to deploy to Windows Server instances, use `AWSCodePipeline-S3-AWSCodeDeploy_Windows.zip`\.

   1. Choose **View Raw**, and then save the sample file to your local computer\. 

      Download the compressed \(zipped\) file\. Do not unzip the file\. For example, save the `aws-codepipeline-s3-aws-codedeploy_linux.zip` file to your desktop and do not extract the files\.

1. In the Amazon S3 console for your bucket, upload the file: 

   1. Choose **Upload**\. 

   1. Drag and drop the file or choose **Add files** and browse for the file\. For example, choose the `aws-codepipeline-s3-aws-codedeploy_linux.zip` file from your desktop\.

   1. Choose **Upload**\.

## Step 2: Create Amazon EC2 Windows Instances and Install the CodeDeploy Agent<a name="S3-create-instances"></a>

**Note**  
This tutorial provides sample steps for creating Amazon EC2 Windows instances\. For sample steps to create Amazon EC2 Linux instances, see Step 3: Create an Amazon EC2 Linux Instance and Install the CodeDeploy Agent in [Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline \(CodeCommit Repository\)](tutorials-simple-codecommit.md)\.

In this step, you create the Windows Server Amazon EC2 instances to which you will deploy a sample application\. As part of this process, you install the CodeDeploy agent on the instances\. The CodeDeploy agent is a software package that enables an instance to be used in CodeDeploy deployments\.

**To launch instances**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. From the console dashboard, choose **Launch Instance**\.

1. On the **Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)** page, locate the row for the HVM edition of the **Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base**, and then choose **Select**\. \(This AMI is labeled "Free tier eligible" and can be found at the top of the list\.\)

1. On the **Step 2: Choose an Instance Type** page, choose the free tier eligible `t2.micro` type as the hardware configuration for your instance, and then choose **Next: Configure Instance Details**\.

1. On the **Step 3: Configure Instance Details** page, do the following:
   + In **Number of instances**, enter `2`\.
   + In **Auto\-assign Public IP**, choose **Enable**\.
   + In **IAM role**, choose an IAM role that has been configured for use as an IAM instance profile for use with CodeDeploy\. If you do not have an IAM instance profile, choose **Create new IAM role** and follow the instructions in [Create an IAM Instance Profile for Your Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-create-iam-instance-profile.html)\.
**Note**  
For the purposes of this tutorial, you can use the following unrestricted policy in your IAM instance profile for CodeDeploy\. For pipelines you use in your development workflows, you might create a more restrictive bucket policy\.  

     ```
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Action": [
             "s3:Get*",
             "s3:List*"
           ],
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

1. On the **Step 3: Configure Instance Details** page, expand **Advanced Details**, and in **User data**, with **As text** selected, type the following:

   ```
   <powershell>  
   New-Item -Path c:\temp -ItemType "directory" -Force
   powershell.exe -Command Read-S3Object -BucketName bucket-name/latest -Key codedeploy-agent.msi -File c:\temp\codedeploy-agent.msi
   Start-Process -Wait -FilePath c:\temp\codedeploy-agent.msi -WindowStyle Hidden
   </powershell>
   ```

   *bucket\-name* is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the CodeDeploy Resource Kit files for your region\. For example, for the US West \(Oregon\) Region, replace *bucket\-name* with `aws-codedeploy-uswest-2`\. For a list of bucket names, see [Resource Kit Bucket Names by Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/resource-kit.html#resource-kit-bucket-names)\.

   This code installs the CodeDeploy agent on your instance as it is created\. This script is written for Windows instances only\.

1. Leave the rest of the items on the **Step 3: Configure Instance Details** page unchanged\. Choose **Next: Add Storage**, leave the **Step 4: Add Storage** page unchanged, and then choose **Next: Add Tags**\.

1. On the **Add Tags** page, with **Name** displayed in the **Key** box, type `MyCodePipelineDemo` in the **Value** box, and then choose **Next: Configure Security Group**\.
**Important**  
The **Key** and **Value** boxes are case\-sensitive\.

1. On the **Configure Security Group** page, allow port 80 communication so you can access the public instance endpoint\.

1. Choose **Review and Launch**\.

1. On the **Review Instance Launch** page, choose **Launch**\.

1. Choose **View Instances** to close the confirmation page and return to the console\.

1. You can view the status of the launch on the **Instances** page\. When you launch an instance, its initial state is `pending`\. After the instance starts, its state changes to `running`, and it receives a public DNS name\. \(If the **Public DNS** column is not displayed, choose the **Show/Hide** icon, and then select **Public DNS**\.\)

1. It can take a few minutes for the instance to be ready for you to connect to it\. Check that your instance has passed its status checks\. You can view this information in the **Status Checks** column\.

## Step 3: Create an Application in CodeDeploy<a name="S3-create-deployment"></a>

In CodeDeploy, an *application* is an identifier, in the form of a name, for the code you want to deploy\. CodeDeploy uses this name to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment\. You select the name of the CodeDeploy application you create in this step when you create your pipeline later in this tutorial\.

**To create an application in CodeDeploy**

1. Open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.

1. If the **Applications** page does not appear, on the AWS CodeDeploy menu, choose **Applications**\.

1. Choose **Create application**\.

1. Leave **Custom application** selected\. In **Application name**, type `MyDemoApplication`\. 

1. In **Compute Platform**, choose **EC2/On\-premises**\.

1. Choose **Create application**\.

**To create a deployment group in CodeDeploy**

1. On the page that displays your application, choose **Create deployment group**\.

1. In **Deployment group name**, type `MyDemoDeploymentGroup`\.

1. In **Service Role**, choose a service role that trusts AWS CodeDeploy with, at minimum, the trust and permissions described in [Create a Service Role for CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-create-service-role.html)\. To get the service role ARN, see [Get the Service Role ARN \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-create-service-role.html#how-to-create-service-role-get-role-console)\.

1. Under **Deployment type**, choose **In\-place**\.

1. Under **Environment configuration**, choose **Amazon EC2 Instances**\. Choose **Name** in the **Key** box, and in the **Value** box, type `MyCodePipelineDemo`\. 
**Important**  
You must choose the same value for the **Name** key here that you assigned to your Amazon EC2 instance when you created it\. If you tagged your instance with something other than `MyCodePipelineDemo`, be sure to use it here\.

1. Under **Deployment configuration**, choose `CodeDeployDefault.OneAtaTime`\.

1. Under **Load Balancer**, clear **Enable load balancing**\.

1. Expand the **Advanced** section\. Under **Alarms**, choose **Ignore alarm configuration**\.

1. Choose **Create deployment group**\.

## Step 4: Create Your First Pipeline in CodePipeline<a name="s3-create-pipeline"></a>

In this part of the tutorial, you create the pipeline\. The sample runs automatically through the pipeline\.

**To create a CodePipeline automated release process**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console at [http://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home](http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home)\.

1. On the **Welcome** page, **Getting started** page, or the **Pipelines** page, choose **Create pipeline**\.

1. In **Step 1: Choose pipeline settings**, in **Pipeline name**, enter **MyFirstPipeline**\. 
**Note**  
If you choose another name for your pipeline, be sure to use that name instead of *MyFirstPipeline* for the rest of this tutorial\. After you create a pipeline, you cannot change its name\. Pipeline names are subject to some limitations\. For more information, see [Limits in AWS CodePipeline](limits.md)\. 

1. In **Service role**, do one of the following:
   + Choose **New service role** to allow CodePipeline to create a new service role in IAM\. In **Role name**, the role and policy name both default to this format: AWSCodePipelineServiceRole\-*region*\-*pipeline\_name*\. For example, this is the service role created for this tutorial: AWSCodePipelineServiceRole\-eu\-west\-2\-MyFirstPipeline\.
   + Choose **Existing service role** to use a service role already created in IAM\. In **Role name**, choose your service role from the list\.
**Note**  
Depending on when your service role was created, you might need to update its permissions to support additional AWS services\. For information, see [Add Permissions for Other AWS Services](how-to-custom-role.md#how-to-update-role-new-services)\. 

1. In **Artifact location**, do one of the following: 

   1. Choose **Default location** to use the default artifact store, such as the Amazon S3 artifact bucket designated as the default, for your pipeline in the region you have selected for your pipeline\.

   1. Choose **Custom location** if you already have an existing artifact store you have created, such as an Amazon S3 artifact bucket, in the same region as your pipeline\.
**Note**  
This is not the source bucket for your source code\. This is the artifact store for your pipeline\. A separate artifact store, such as an Amazon S3 bucket, is required for each pipeline\. When you create or edit a pipeline, you must have an artifact bucket in the pipeline Region, and then you must have one artifact bucket per AWS Region where you are running an action\.  
For more information, see [A Quick Look at Input and Output Artifacts](welcome.md#welcome-introducing-artifacts) and [CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md)\.

   Choose **Next**\.

1. In **Step 2: Add source stage**, in **Source provider**, choose **Amazon S3**\. In **Bucket**, enter the name of the Amazon S3 bucket you created in [Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket for Your Application](#s3-create-s3-bucket)\. In **S3 object key**, enter the sample file you copied to that bucket, either `aws-codepipeline-s3-aws-codedeploy_linux.zip` or `AWSCodePipeline-S3-AWSCodeDeploy_Windows.zip`\. Choose **Next step**\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/images/codepipeline-wizard-source-pol.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)

   For example, if you named your bucket **awscodepipeline\-demobucket\-example\-date** and you chose Amazon Linux for your Amazon EC2 instances in CodeDeploy, enter:

   ```
   s3://awscodepipeline-demobucket-example-date/aws-codepipeline-s3-aws-codedeploy_linux.zip
   ```

   If you named your bucket **awscodepipeline\-demobucket\-example\-date** and you chose Windows for your Amazon EC2 instances in CodeDeploy, enter:

   ```
   s3://awscodepipeline-demobucket-example-date/AWSCodePipeline-S3-AWSCodeDeploy_Windows.zip
   ```
**Note**  
If you copied the sample application to a GitHub repository instead of an Amazon S3 bucket, choose **GitHub** from the list of source providers, and then follow the instructions\. For more information, see [Create a Pipeline \(Console\)](pipelines-create.md#pipelines-create-console)\.

   Under **Change detection options**, leave the defaults\. This allows CodePipeline to use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect changes in your source bucket\.

    Choose **Next**\.

1. In **Step 3: Add build stage**, choose **Skip build stage**, and then accept the warning message by choosing **Skip** again\. Choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
You can configure a build action with a provider such as CodeBuild, which is a fully managed build service in the cloud\. You can also configure a build action that uses a provider with a build server or system, such as Jenkins\. You can walk through the steps for setting up build resources and creating a pipeline that uses those resources in the next tutorial, [Tutorial: Create a Four\-Stage Pipeline](tutorials-four-stage-pipeline.md)\.

1. In **Step 4: Add deploy stage**, in **Deploy provider**, choose **AWS CodeDeploy**\. The **Region** field defaults to the same AWS Region as your pipeline\. In **Application name**, enter **CodePipelineDemoApplication**, or choose the **Refresh** button, and then choose the application name from the list\. In **Deployment group**, type **CodePipelineDemoFleet**, or choose it from the list, and then choose **Next**\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/images/codepipeline-wizard-deploy-pol.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)
**Note**  
The name "Deploy" is the name given by default to the stage created in the **Step 4: Add deploy stage** step, just as "Source" is the name given to the first stage of the pipeline\. 

1. In **Step 5: Review**, review the information, and then choose **Create pipeline**\.

1. The pipeline starts to run\. You can view progress and success and failure messages as the CodePipeline sample deploys a webpage to each of the Amazon EC2 instances in the CodeDeploy deployment\.

Congratulations\! You just created a simple pipeline in CodePipeline\. The pipeline has two stages:
+ A source stage named **Source**, which detects changes in the versioned sample application stored in the Amazon S3 bucket and pulls those changes into the pipeline\.
+ A **Deploy** stage that deploys those changes to Amazon EC2 instances with CodeDeploy\. 

Now, verify the results\.

**To verify your pipeline ran successfully**

1. View the initial progress of the pipeline\. The status of each stage changes from **No executions yet** to **In Progress**, and then to either **Succeeded** or **Failed**\. The pipeline should complete the first run within a few minutes\.

1. After **Succeeded** is displayed for the action status, in the status area for the **Staging** stage, choose **Details**\. This opens the AWS CodeDeploy console\.

1. In the **Deployment group** tab, under **Deployment lifecycle events**, choose the instance ID\. This opens the EC2 console\.

1. On the **Description** tab, in **Public DNS**, copy the address, and then paste it into the address bar of your web browser\. View the index page for the sample application you uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket\.

   The following page is the sample application you uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/images/codepipeline-demo-success-message.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)

For more information about stages, actions, and how pipelines work, see [CodePipeline Concepts](concepts.md)\.

## Step 5: Add Another Stage to Your Pipeline<a name="s3-add-stage"></a>

Now add another stage in the pipeline to deploy from staging servers to production servers using CodeDeploy\. First, you create another deployment group in the CodePipelineDemoApplication in CodeDeploy\. Then you add a stage that includes an action that uses this deployment group\. To add another stage, you use the CodePipeline console or the AWS CLI to retrieve and manually edit the structure of the pipeline in a JSON file, and then run the update\-pipeline command to update the pipeline with your changes\.

**Topics**
+ [Create a Second Deployment Group in CodeDeploy](#s3-add-stage-part-1)
+ [Add the Deployment Group as Another Stage in Your Pipeline](#s3-add-stage-part-2)

### Create a Second Deployment Group in CodeDeploy<a name="s3-add-stage-part-1"></a>

**Note**  
In this part of the tutorial, you create a second deployment group, but deploy to the same Amazon EC2 instances as before\. This is for demonstration purposes only\. It is purposely designed to fail to show you how errors are displayed in CodePipeline\.

**To create a second deployment group in CodeDeploy**

1. Open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.

1. Choose **Applications**, and in the list of applications, choose **CodePipelineDemoApplication**\.

1. Choose the **Deployment groups** tab, and then choose **Create deployment group**\.

1. On the **Create deployment group** page, in **Deployment group name**, enter a name for the second deployment group \(for example, **CodePipelineProductionFleet**\)\.

1. Choose **In\-place deployment**\.

1. In **Key**, enter **Name**, but in **Value**, choose **CodePipelineDemo** from the list\. Leave the default configuration for **Deployment configuration**\. In **Service role ARN**, choose the same CodeDeploy service role you used for the initial deployment \(not the CodePipeline service role\), and then choose **Create deployment group**\.

### Add the Deployment Group as Another Stage in Your Pipeline<a name="s3-add-stage-part-2"></a>

Now that you have another deployment group, you can add a stage that uses this deployment group to deploy to the same Amazon EC2 instances you used earlier\. You can use the CodePipeline console or the AWS CLI to add this stage\. 

**Topics**
+ [Create a Third Stage \(Console\)](#s3-add-stage-part-2-console)
+ [Create a Third Stage \(CLI\)](#s3-add-stage-part-2-cli)

#### Create a Third Stage \(Console\)<a name="s3-add-stage-part-2-console"></a>

You can use the CodePipeline console to add a new stage that uses the new deployment group\. Because this deployment group is deploying to the Amazon EC2 instances you've already used, the deploy action in this stage fails\. 

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console at [http://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home](http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home)\.

1. In **Name**, choose the name of the pipeline you created, MyFirstPipeline\. 

1. On the pipeline details page, choose **Edit**\. 

1. On the **Edit** page, choose **\+ Add stage** to add a stage immediately after the Deploy stage\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/images/edit-pipeline-console-pol.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)

1. In **Add stage**, in **Stage name**, enter **Production**\. Choose **Add stage**\.

1. In the new stage, choose **\+ Add action group**\.

1. In **Edit action**, in **Action name**, enter **Deploy\-Second\-Deployment**\. In **Action provider**, under **Deploy**, choose **AWS CodeDeploy**\.

1. In the CodeDeploy section, in **Application name**, choose **CodePipelineDemoApplication** from the drop\-down list, as you did when you created the pipeline\. In **Deployment group**, choose the deployment group you just created, **CodePipelineProductionFleet**\. In **Input artifacts**, choose **MyApp**\. Choose **Save**\.
**Note**  
The source artifact is the name of the input artifact, **MyApp**, that was created for you in the **Create pipeline** wizard as the output artifact of the source action\. Every action has an input artifact \(the artifact the action works on\), an output artifact \(the product or result of the action\), or both, depending on the action type\. In this example, the deploy action inputs the output of the source action in the source stage, `MyApp`, and deploys it\. Because the action configured for the previous stage \(Deploy\) has already deployed the application to the same Amazon EC2 instances, this action fails\. For more information about input and output artifacts and the structure of pipelines, see [CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md)\.

1. On the **Edit** page, choose **Save**\. In **Save pipeline changes**, choose **Save**\.

1. Although the new stage has been added to your pipeline, a status of **No executions yet** is displayed because no changes have triggered another run of the pipeline\. You must manually rerun the last revision to see how the edited pipeline runs\. On the pipeline details page, choose **Release change**, and then choose **Release** when prompted\. This runs the most recent revision available in each source location specified in a source action through the pipeline\. 

   Alternatively, to use the AWS CLI to rerun the pipeline, from a terminal on your local Linux, macOS, or Unix machine, or a command prompt on your local Windows machine, run the start\-pipeline\-execution command, specifying the name of the pipeline\. This runs the application in your source bucket through the pipeline for a second time\.

   ```
   aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name MyFirstPipeline
   ```

   This command returns a `pipelineExecutionId` object\.

1. Return to the CodePipeline console and in the list of pipelines, choose **MyFirstPipeline** to open the view page\.

   The pipeline shows three stages and the state of the artifact running through those three stages\. It might take up to five minutes for the pipeline to run through all stages\. You see the deployment succeeds on the first two stages, just as before, but the **Production** stage shows the **Deploy\-Second\-Deployment** action failed\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/images/codepipeline-failed-third-stage.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)

1. In the **Deploy\-Second\-Deployment** action, choose **Details**\. You are redirected to the page for the CodeDeploy deployment\. In this case, the failure is the result of the first instance group deploying to all of the Amazon EC2 instances, leaving no instances for the second deployment group\.
**Note**  
This failure is by design, to demonstrate what happens when there is a failure in a pipeline stage\.

#### Create a Third Stage \(CLI\)<a name="s3-add-stage-part-2-cli"></a>

Although using the AWS CLI to add a stage to your pipeline is more complex than using the console, it provides more visibility into the structure of the pipeline\.

**To create a third stage for your pipeline**

1. Open a terminal session on your local Linux, macOS, or Unix machine, or a command prompt on your local Windows machine, and run the get\-pipeline command to display the structure of the pipeline you just created\. For **MyFirstPipeline**, you would type the following command: 

   ```
   aws codepipeline get-pipeline --name "MyFirstPipeline"
   ```

   This command returns the structure of MyFirstPipeline\. The first part of the output should look similar to the following:

   ```
   {
       "pipeline": {
           "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::80398EXAMPLE:role/AWS-CodePipeline-Service",
           "stages": [
       ...
   ```

   The final part of the output includes the pipeline metadata and should look similar to the following:

   ```
       ...
           ],
           "artifactStore": {
               "type": "S3"
               "location": "codepipeline-us-east-2-250656481468",
           },
           "name": "MyFirstPipeline",
           "version": 4
       },
       "metadata": {
           "pipelineArn": "arn:aws:codepipeline:us-east-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyFirstPipeline",
           "updated": 1501626591.112,
           "created": 1501626591.112
       }
   }
   ```

1. Copy and paste this structure into a plain\-text editor, and save the file as **pipeline\.json**\. For convenience, save this file in the same directory where you run the aws codepipeline commands\.
**Note**  
You can pipe the JSON directly into a file with the get\-pipeline command as follows:  

   ```
   aws codepipeline get-pipeline --name MyFirstPipeline >pipeline.json
   ```

1. Copy the **Staging** stage section and paste it after the first two stages\. Because it is a deploy stage, just like the **Staging** stage, you use it as a template for the third stage\. 

1. Change the name of the stage and the deployment group details\. 

   The following example shows the JSON you add to the pipeline\.json file after the **Staging** stage\. Edit the emphasized elements with new values\. Remember to include a comma to separate the **Staging** and **Production** stage definitions\.

   ```
   ,
   {
       "name": "Production",
        "actions": [
           {
            "inputArtifacts": [
                {
                 "name": "MyApp"
                }
              ],
             "name": "Deploy-Second-Deployment",
             "actionTypeId": {
                 "category": "Deploy",
                 "owner": "AWS",
                 "version": "1",
                 "provider": "CodeDeploy"
                 },
            "outputArtifacts": [],
            "configuration": {
                 "ApplicationName": "CodePipelineDemoApplication",
                 "DeploymentGroupName": "CodePipelineProductionFleet"
                  },
            "runOrder": 1
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. If you are working with the pipeline structure retrieved using the get\-pipeline command, you must remove the `metadata` lines from the JSON file\. Otherwise, the update\-pipeline command cannot use it\. Remove the `"metadata": { }` lines and the `"created"`, `"pipelineARN"`, and `"updated"` fields\.

   For example, remove the following lines from the structure:

   ```
   "metadata": {  
     "pipelineArn": "arn:aws:codepipeline:region:account-ID:pipeline-name",
     "created": "date",
     "updated": "date"
     }
   ```

   Save the file\.

1. Run the update\-pipeline command, specifying the pipeline JSON file, similar to the following:

   ```
   aws codepipeline update-pipeline --cli-input-json file://pipeline.json
   ```

   This command returns the entire structure of the updated pipeline\.
**Important**  
Be sure to include `file://` before the file name\. It is required in this command\.

1.  Run the start\-pipeline\-execution command, specifying the name of the pipeline\. This runs the application in your source bucket through the pipeline for a second time\.

   ```
   aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name MyFirstPipeline
   ```

   This command returns a `pipelineExecutionId` object\.

1. Open the CodePipeline console and choose **MyFirstPipeline** from the list of pipelines\.

   The pipeline shows three stages and the state of the artifact running through those three stages\. It might take up to five minutes for the pipeline to run through all stages\. Although the deployment succeeds on the first two stages, just as before, the **Production** stage shows that the **Deploy\-Second\-Deployment** action failed\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/images/codepipeline-failed-third-stage.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)

1. In the **Deploy\-Second\-Deployment** action, choose **Details** to see details of the failure\. You are redirected to the details page for the CodeDeploy deployment\. In this case, the failure is the result of the first instance group deploying to all of the Amazon EC2 instances, leaving no instances for the second deployment group\. 
**Note**  
This failure is by design, to demonstrate what happens when there is a failure in a pipeline stage\.

## Step 6: Disable and Enable Transitions Between Stages in CodePipeline<a name="s3-configure-transitions"></a>

You can enable or disable the transition between stages in a pipeline\. Disabling the transition between stages allows you to manually control transitions between one stage and another\. For example, you might want to run the first two stages of a pipeline, but disable transitions to the third stage until you are ready to deploy to production, or while you troubleshoot a problem or failure with that stage\.

**To disable and enable transitions between stages in a CodePipeline pipeline**

1. Open the CodePipeline console and choose **MyFirstPipeline** from the list of pipelines\.

1. On the details page for the pipeline, choose the **Disable transition** button between the second stage \(**Staging**\) and the third stage that you added in the previous section \(**Production**\)\.

1. In **Disable transition**, enter a reason for disabling the transition between the stages, and then choose **Disable**\.

   The arrow between stages displays an icon and color change, and the **Enable transition** button\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/images/codepipeline-disabled-transition-pol.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/)

1. Upload your sample again to the Amazon S3 bucket\. Because the bucket is versioned, this change starts the pipeline\. For information, see [](#getting-started-upload-s3)\.

1. Return to the details page for your pipeline and watch the status of the stages\. The pipeline view changes to show progress and success on the first two stages, but no changes occur on the third stage\. This process might take a few minutes\.

1. Enable the transition by choosing the **Enable transition** button between the two stages\. In the **Enable transition** dialog box, choose **Enable**\. The stage starts running in a few minutes and attempts to process the artifact that has already been run through the first two stages of the pipeline\.
**Note**  
If you want this third stage to succeed, edit the CodePipelineProductionFleet deployment group before you enable the transition, and specify a different set of Amazon EC2 instances where the application is deployed\. For more information about how to do this, see [Change Deployment Group Settings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-change-deployment-group-settings.html)\. If you create more Amazon EC2 instances, you may incur additional costs\. 

## Step 7: Clean Up Resources<a name="s3-clean-up"></a>

You can use some of the resources you created in this tutorial for the [Tutorial: Create a Four\-Stage Pipeline](tutorials-four-stage-pipeline.md)\. For example, you can reuse the CodeDeploy application and deployment\. However, after you complete this and any other tutorials, you should delete the pipeline and the resources it uses, so that you are not charged for the continued use of those resources\. First, delete the pipeline, then the CodeDeploy application and its associated Amazon EC2 instances, and finally, the Amazon S3 bucket\.

**To clean up the resources used in this tutorial**

1. To clean up your CodePipeline resources, follow the instructions in [Delete a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-delete.md)\.

1. To clean up your CodeDeploy resources, follow the instructions in [Clean Up Deployment Walkthrough Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/tutorials-wordpress-clean-up.html#tutorials-wordpress-clean-up-console)\.

1. To delete the Amazon S3 bucket, follow the instructions in [Deleting or Emptying an Amazon S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/DeletingaBucket.html)\. If you do not intend to create more pipelines, delete the Amazon S3 bucket created for storing your pipeline artifacts\. For more information about this bucket, see [CodePipeline Concepts](concepts.md)\.
