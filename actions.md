# Working with Actions in CodePipeline<a name="actions"></a>

In AWS CodePipeline, an action is part of the sequence in a stage of a pipeline\. It is a task performed on the artifact in that stage\. Pipeline actions occur in a specified order, in sequence or in parallel, as determined in the configuration of the stage\.

CodePipeline provides support for six types of actions:
+ Source 
+ Build 
+ Test 
+ Deploy 
+ Approval 
+ Invoke 

For information about the AWS services and partner products and services you can integrate into your pipeline based on action type, see [Integrations with CodePipeline Action Types](integrations-action-type.md)\.
