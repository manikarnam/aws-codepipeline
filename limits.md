# Limits in AWS CodePipeline<a name="limits"></a>

The following table lists current limits in AWS CodePipeline\. Structural requirements are discussed in [CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md)\. For information about limits that can be changed, see [AWS Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_codepipeline)\.


|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
|  Maximum number of total pipelines per Region in an AWS account  |  300  | 
|  Maximum number of pipelines per Region with change detection set to periodically checking for source changes  |  60  Instead of using periodic checks, configure your pipeline to use the recommended change\-detection method for your source type\. For example, configure your AWS CodeCommit pipeline to use Amazon CloudWatch Events for change detection\. See [ Change Detection Methods Used to Start Pipelines Automatically](pipelines-about-starting.md#change-detection-methods) for instructions specific to your source type\.   | 
|  Number of stages in a pipeline  |  Minimum of 2, maximum of 10  | 
|  Number of actions in a stage  |  Minimum of 1, maximum of 50  | 
| Maximum number of custom actions per Region in an AWS account | 50 | 
| Maximum number of parallel actions in a stage | 50 | 
| Maximum number of sequential actions in a stage | 50 | 
| Maximum number of webhooks per Region in an AWS account | 300 | 
|  Length of time before an action times out  |  Approval action: 7 days AWS CloudFormation deployment action: 3 days CodeBuild build action and test action: 8 hours CodeDeploy and CodeDeploy ECS \(Blue/Green\) deployment actions: 5 days AWS Lambda invoke action: 1 hour  CodePipeline waits one hour to determine if a Lambda invoke action failed\. If the action times out, CodePipeline sets the invoke action state to failed\. AWS Lambda has a maximum execution duration per request limit\. This limit is set in AWS Lambda \(see [AWS Lambda Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html)\) and does not affect the action timeout in CodePipeline\.  Amazon S3 deployment action: 20 minutes All other actions: 1 hour  | 
| Maximum number of months for which pipeline execution history information is retained | 12 | 
|  Regions where you can create a pipeline  |  US East \(Ohio\) \(us\-east\-2\) US East \(N\. Virginia\) \(us\-east\-1\) US West \(N\. California\) \(us\-west\-1\) US West \(Oregon\) \(us\-west\-2\) Canada \(Central\) \(ca\-central\-1\) EU \(Ireland\) \(eu\-west\-1\) EU \(London\) \(eu\-west\-2\) EU \(Paris\) \(eu\-west\-3\) EU \(Frankfurt\) \(eu\-central\-1\) Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\) \(ap\-south\-1\) Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) \(ap\-northeast\-1\) Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) \(ap\-northeast\-2\) Asia Pacific \(Singapore\) \(ap\-southeast\-1\) Asia Pacific \(Sydney\) \(ap\-southeast\-2\) South America \(SÃ£o Paulo\) \(sa\-east\-1\)  | 
| Maximum size of artifacts in a source stage |  Artifacts stored in Amazon S3 buckets: 3 GB Artifacts stored in CodeCommit or GitHub repositories: 1 GB Exception: If you are using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy applications, the maximum artifact size is always 512 MB\.  | 
| Maximum size of input artifacts for AWS CloudFormation actions | If you are using AWS CloudFormation to deploy Lambda functions, the Lambda code archive size should not exceed 256 MB\. See [AWS Lambda Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html)\. | 
| Uniqueness of names |  Within a single AWS account, each pipeline you create in a Region must have a unique name\. Names can be reused for pipelines in different Regions\.  Stage names must be unique within a pipeline\. Action names must be unique within a stage\.  | 
| Characters allowed in pipeline name |  Pipeline names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.   | 
| Characters allowed in stage name |  Stage names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in action name |  Action names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in action types |  Action type names cannot exceed 25 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in partner action names | Partner action names must follow the same naming conventions and restrictions as other action names in CodePipeline\. Specifically, they cannot exceed 100 characters, and the following characters are allowed: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\.The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\.The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\.The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\.Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\. | 
|  Maximum size of the JSON object that can be stored in the `ParameterOverrides` property  | For a CodePipeline deploy action with AWS CloudFormation as the provider, the ParameterOverrides property is used to store a JSON object that specifies values for the AWS CloudFormation template configuration file\. There is a maximum size limit of 1 kilobyte for the JSON object that can be stored in the ParameterOverrides property\. | 
|  Maximum size of the image definitions JSON file used in pipelines deploying Amazon ECS containers and images  | 100 KB |
