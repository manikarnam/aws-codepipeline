# CodePipeline Permissions Reference<a name="permissions-reference"></a>

When you are setting up [Access Control with IAM Policies](access-control.md) and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity \(identity\-based policies\), you can use the following table as a reference\. The table lists each CodePipeline API operation and the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action\. You specify the actions in the policy's `Action` field, and you specify a wildcard character \(\*\) as the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field\.

You can use AWS\-wide condition keys in your CodePipeline policies to express conditions\. For a complete list of AWS\-wide keys, see [Available Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Note**  
To specify an action, use the `codepipeline:` prefix followed by the API operation name\. For example: `codepipeline:GetPipeline`, `codepipeline:CreatePipeline`, or `codepipeline:*` \(for all CodePipeline actions\)\.

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:

```
"Action": ["codepipeline:action1", "codepipeline:action2"]
```

You can also specify multiple actions using wildcards\. For example, you can specify all actions whose name begins with the word "Get" as follows:

```
"Action": "codepipeline:Get*"
```

To specify all CodePipeline API actions, use the \* wildcard as follows:

```
"Action": "codepipeline:*"
```

The actions you can specify in an IAM policy for use with CodePipeline are listed below\.
