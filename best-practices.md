## Best Practices<a name="best-practices-1"></a>

Use the best practices outlined in these sections when using CodePipeline\.

### Security Best Practices for CodePipeline Resources<a name="best-practices-security"></a>

You use encryption and authentication for the source repositories that connect to your pipelines\. These are the CodePipeline best practices for security:
+ If you create a pipeline that uses an Amazon S3 source bucket, configure server\-side encryption for artifacts stored in Amazon S3 for CodePipeline by managing AWS KMS\-managed keys \(SSE\-KMS\), as described in [Configure Server\-Side Encryption for Artifacts Stored in Amazon S3 for CodePipeline](S3-artifact-encryption.md)\.
+ If you create a pipeline that uses a GitHub source repository, configure GitHub authentication\. You can use an AWS\-managed OAuth token or a customer\-managed personal access token, as described in [Configure GitHub Authentication](GitHub-authentication.md)\.

### Monitoring and Logging Best Practices for CodePipeline Resources<a name="best-practices-monitoring"></a>

You can use logging features in AWS to determine the actions users have taken in your account and the resources that were used\. The log files show:
+ The time and date of actions\.
+ The source IP address for an action\.
+ Which actions failed due to inadequate permissions\. 

Logging features are available in the following AWS services:
+ AWS CloudTrail can be used to log AWS API calls and related events made by or on behalf of an AWS account\. For more information, see [Logging CodePipeline API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](monitoring-cloudtrail-logs.md)\.
+ Amazon CloudWatch Events can be used to monitor your AWS Cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS\. You can create alerts in Amazon CloudWatch Events based on metrics that you define\. For more information, see [Detect and React to Changes in Pipeline State with Amazon CloudWatch Events](detect-state-changes-cloudwatch-events.md)\.

### Best Practices for the Jenkins PlugIn<a name="best-practices-jenkins"></a>

Use the best practices provided in this section for pipelines with a Jenkins action provider\.

#### Configure a Separate Amazon EC2 Instance and IAM Role for Your Jenkins Build Server<a name="best-practices-jenkins-instance"></a>

As a best practice, when you use a Jenkins build provider for your pipeline’s build or test action, install Jenkins on an Amazon EC2 instance and configure a separate EC2 instance profile\. Make sure the instance profile grants Jenkins only the AWS permissions required to perform tasks for your project, such as retrieving files from Amazon S3\. 

The instance profile provides applications running on an Amazon EC2 instance with the credentials to access other AWS services\. As a result, you do not need to configure AWS credentials \(AWS access key and secret key\)\.

To learn how to create the role for your Jenkins instance profile, see the steps in [Create an IAM Role to Use for Jenkins Integration](tutorials-four-stage-pipeline.md#tutorials-four-stage-pipeline-prerequisites-jenkins-iam-role)\.

## Use Cases for CodePipeline<a name="use-cases"></a>

You can create pipelines that integrate with other AWS services\. These can be AWS services, such as Amazon S3, or third\-party products, such as GitHub\. This section provides examples for using CodePipeline to automate your code releases using different product integrations\. For a full list of integrations with CodePipeline organized by action type, see [CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md)\.

### Use CodePipeline with Amazon S3, AWS CodeCommit, and AWS CodeDeploy<a name="use-cases-S3-codedeploy"></a>

When you create a pipeline, CodePipeline integrates with AWS products and services that act as action providers in each stage of your pipeline\. When you choose stages in the wizard, you must choose a source stage and at least a build or deploy stage\. The wizard creates the stages for you with default names that cannot be changed\. These are the stage names created when you set up a full three\-stage pipeline in the wizard:
+ A source action stage with a default name of “Source\.”
+ A build action stage with a default name of “Build\.”
+ A deploy action stage with a default name of “Staging\.”

You can use the tutorials in this guide to create pipelines and specify stages:
+ The steps in [Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline \(Amazon S3 Bucket\)](tutorials-simple-s3.md) help you use the wizard to create a pipeline with two default stages: “Source” and “Staging”, where your Amazon S3 repository is the source provider\. This tutorial creates a pipeline that uses AWS CodeDeploy to deploy a sample application from an Amazon S3 bucket to Amazon EC2 instances running Amazon Linux\.
+ The steps in [Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline \(CodeCommit Repository\)](tutorials-simple-codecommit.md) help you use the wizard to create a pipeline with a “Source” stage that uses your AWS CodeCommit repository as the source provider\. This tutorial creates a pipeline that uses AWS CodeDeploy to deploy a sample application from an AWS CodeCommit repository to an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux\.

### Use CodePipeline with Third\-party Action Providers \(GitHub and Jenkins\)<a name="use-cases-thirdparty"></a>

You can create pipelines that integrate with third\-party products such as GitHub and Jenkins\. The steps in [Tutorial: Create a Four\-Stage Pipeline](tutorials-four-stage-pipeline.md) show you how to create a pipeline that:
+ Gets source code from a GitHub repository,
+ Uses Jenkins to build and test the source code,
+ Uses AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the built and tested source code to Amazon EC2 instances running Amazon Linux or Microsoft Windows Server\.

### Use CodePipeline with AWS CodeStar to Build a Pipeline in a Code Project<a name="use-cases-codestar"></a>

AWS CodeStar is a cloud\-based service that provides a unified user interface for managing software development projects on AWS\. AWS CodeStar works with CodePipeline to combine AWS resources into a project development toolchain\. You can use your AWS CodeStar dashboard to automatically create the pipeline, repositories, source code, build spec files, deployment method, and hosting instances or serverless instances required for a complete code project\.

To create your AWS CodeStar project, you choose your coding language and the type of application you want to deploy\. You can create the following project types: a web application, a web service, or an Alexa skill\.

At any time, you can integrate your preferred IDE into your AWS CodeStar dashboard\. You can also add and remove team members and manage permissions for team members on your project\. For a tutorial that shows you how to use AWS CodeStar to create a sample pipeline for a serverless application, see [Tutorial: Creating and Managing a Serverless Project in AWS CodeStar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/sam-tutorial.html)\.
